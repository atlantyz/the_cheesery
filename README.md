### Description

For this project, we created a database of cheeses made and sold in Texas, from a variety of Texas cheesemakers. Our new online shop, The Cheesery, will use this database to create a machine learning model that will recommend a Texas cheese for new customers, using cheese characteristics, including flavor and texture. This project will provide engaging visualizations and a fun recommendation survey.

### Background

The Cheesery is an online cheese shop that highlights cheeses from Texan cheesemakers. Because these cheeses are primarily available in Texas, new customers may not be familiar with the flavor and texture of these cheeses. Thus, we created an extensive database of Texas-made cheeses to help new customers choose a Texas cheese for them based on general cheese characteristics.

### Source Data

Following extensive research, we created a database that detailed the variety of cheeses that are made and sold in Texas, by Texan cheesemakers. In addition to the details of individual cheeses from the Texas cheesemakers, we added general cheese data, including cheese family and texture, from Cheese.com. 

This data contains specific and general details of cheese from Texan cheesemakers:
* Location: Where in Texas the cheesemaker is located. 
* Company: The Texas cheesemaker's business name.
* Cheese identification details: price, milk type, cheese family, (traditional) country of origin, type, texture, etc.

### Data Focus

#### Flavor

The most important aspect of a food product is the taste! The goal of this project is to be able to accurately suggest a Texas cheese that new customers will enjoy based on similar cheese flavor and texture. 

#### Price

The price of each cheese can be a determining factor for new customers. Thus, our Texas Cheese database includes cheeses with a range of prices (by ounce) so that all customers can find a Texas cheese for their budget. 

#### Location

The Cheesery is an online cheese shop focused on cheese created in Texas.

Database
----

For our Database, we decided to collect our own data points on cheese from multiple sources because we could not find a singular 
source that could provide all of the information that we were seeking.

Description of database
----

Our database is filled with a sophisticated selection of different ways to classify cheese. To begin the header titles we have, Names where one can find the many different names of cheese, then to follow we have Company, Location, Price, Milk, Origin, Family, Type, Texture, Color, Flavor, Vegetarian.
