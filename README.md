## Description

This project created a database of cheeses made and sold in Texas, from a variety of Texas cheesemakers. Our new online shop, The Cheesery, will use this database to create a machine learning model that will recommend a Texas cheese for new customers, using characteristics including flavor and texture. This project will provide engaging visualizations and a fun recommendation survey.

## Background

The Cheesery is an online cheese shop that highlights cheeses from Texan cheesemakers. Because these cheeses are primarily available in Texas, new customers may not be familiar with the flavor and texture of these cheeses. Thus, we created an extensive database of Texas-made cheeses to help new customers choose a Texas cheese for them based on general cheese characteristics.

## Data Focus

### Flavor

### Price

### Location
Being that The Cheesery is located in Texas, we will be using Texas cheeses as our initial focus. There is a Texas cheese for everyone and we want to use previous experiences for customers to find something they may love locally.

Machine Learning Model
----
## Preliminary data processing
- Filled in Null values with correct characteristics on cheese.
- Identified data types within dataframe.

Database
----
For our Database, we decided to collect our own data points on cheese from multiple sources because we could not find a singular 
source that could provide all of the information that we were seeking.

Description of database
----
Our database is filled with a sophisticated selection of different ways to classify cheese. To begin the header titles we have, Names where one can find the many different names of cheese, then to follow we have Company, Location, Price, Milk, Origin, Family, Type, Texture, Color, Flavor, Vegetarian.
