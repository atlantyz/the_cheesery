# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Analysis will be completed using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Database Storage
We intend to use pgAdmin and postgresql will be used for data storage.

## Machine Learning
Pandas was used in data preprocessing before we used SciKit Learn as the ML library to create a classifier. 

## Dashboard 
We will use Tableau to create an interactive dashboard and story that allows for customers to filter out elements and see how others are affected.
